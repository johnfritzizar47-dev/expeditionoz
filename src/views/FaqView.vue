      {
        q: 'How do I check availability and make a booking?',
        a: 'Contact our team via the enquiry form or by phone. We\'ll discuss available departure dates, confirm passenger numbers, and guide you through the booking process. A deposit secures your place.'
      },
      {
        q: 'How far in advance should I book?',
        a: 'We recommend booking 3–6 months in advance, particularly for peak season (March–August) when whale sharks are most reliably present. Popular departure dates fill quickly.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What is your cancellation policy?',
        a: 'Cancellations made more than 60 days before departure receive a full refund minus a small administration fee. Within 60 days, we offer a credit to re-book. We strongly recommend travel insurance.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Do you use FareHarbor or another booking system?',

    title: 'The Experience',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'Do I need to be an experienced snorkeler?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Are whale shark encounters guaranteed?',
        a: 'Ningaloo has one of the highest rates of whale shark encounter success in the world. We use a spotter aircraft to locate whale sharks before entering the water. We are proud of our success rate, but as with all wildlife, encounters cannot be 100% guaranteed.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What wildlife might we see?',
        a: 'Beyond whale sharks, expect to encounter manta rays, humpback whales (seasonal), sea turtles, dugongs, reef sharks, dolphins, countless reef fish species, and extraordinary coral gardens.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the daily routine like on board?',
        a: 'Typically: early morning snorkel or dive, breakfast, mid-morning activity, lunch, afternoon exploration, sundowner drinks on deck, gourmet dinner, and stargazing. Each day is flexible based on wildlife and weather.'

    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Onboard Life',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'What is included in the price?',

      },
      {
        q: 'What are the cabins like?',

      },
      {
        q: 'Is there connectivity on board?',
        a: 'We intentionally operate in remote waters with limited connectivity. This is part of the experience — a genuine digital detox. Emergency satellite communication is always available.'
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Practical Information',
    faqs: [
      {
        q: 'When is the best time to visit Ningaloo?',
        a: 'Whale sharks are present from approximately March to August, with peak season April–June. Manta rays are year-round. Humpback whales are seen July–October. We offer expeditions year-round with different seasonal highlights.'

      },
      {
        q: 'Is Expedition OZ environmentally certified?',
        a: 'Yes. We hold marine park operating permits and operate under strict environmental guidelines. We contribute to reef monitoring programs and all our team are trained in responsible wildlife interaction.'
